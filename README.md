This repository contains two files: BST270_FinalProject.Rmd and BST270_FinalProject.pdf

These files are used to reproduce three COVID-19 visualizations and tables found on The New York Times website https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html.

To reproduce the figure and tables, download the Rmd file which includes code and links to appriopriate data sets. Note you do not have to download data, functions within the Rmd file will download the correct data set directly from the websites (https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data and https://covidtracking.com/data/). The pdf file shows the results along with code and comments about reprodubility. The packages needed to recreate figure and table are ggplot2, stringr, zoo, lubridate, tidyverse, kableExtra, and data.table. R version 3.6.3 on macOS Big Sur were used for this project.
